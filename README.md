# meta-luarocks-extra
Extension of [meta-luarocks](https://github.com/chris2511/meta-luarocks) with recipes to support using [lua-docker](https://github.com/rokf/lua-docker). My use case for this is to interact with container engines socket from a SWUpdate lua handler. One can use to `lua-docker` to interact with docker or podman socket.
